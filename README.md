# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
 Nowadays, Driver drowsiness is one of the 
major causes for most of the accidents in the world. In this 
proposed paper, a drowsiness detection model is developed 
which alerts the driver whenever he/she closes his/her eyes 
due to drowsiness and hence improve the traffic safety. This 
model uses libraries like Dlib, Opencv for face detection and 
the 68 face landmarks to extract the facial features. Also, an 
alerting system is added using Arduino by establishing serial 
communication between the computer and Arduino. The
face detection accuracy is enhanced by using Dlib frontal 
face detector instead of Haar Cascades algorithm.
